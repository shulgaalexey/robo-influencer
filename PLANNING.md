**Architecture**: Plan/Act AI Agent System with structured prompts and context management

## 🧠 AI Agent Operating Modes

### Plan Mode 🗺️

In Plan Mode, the AI agent focuses on:

- **Context Gathering**: Reading and understanding existing codebase, documentation, and requirements
- **Architecture Analysis**: Understanding project structure, patterns, and constraints
- **Strategy Development**: Creating comprehensive implementation plans without making changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential issues, dependencies, and edge cases
- **Resource Planning**: Determining required files, modules, and external dependencies

**Plan Mode Behavior**:

- Read relevant files and gather complete context
- Analyze requirements comprehensively
- Develop solution strategies before writing code
- Create detailed step-by-step implementation plans
- Identify all files that need to be created or modified
- Plan testing strategies and validation approaches
- NO code changes are made in Plan Mode

### Act Mode ⚡

In Act Mode, the AI agent focuses on:

- **Implementation**: Executing the approved plan with precision
- **Code Generation**: Writing clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Testing**: Creating and running comprehensive tests
- **Validation**: Ensuring changes work as expected
- **Documentation**: Updating relevant documentation

**Act Mode Behavior**:

- Execute the previously approved plan
- Make actual code changes and file modifications
- Create tests and validate functionality
- Update documentation and README files
- Follow established coding standards and patterns

```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `snake_case` for Python files
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Modules**: Short, descriptive names in `snake_case`

### Code Quality Standards

- **Maximum file length**: 500 lines of code
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions
- **Testing**: Minimum 3 test cases per feature (success, edge case, failure)
- **Formatting**: Black formatter, PEP8 compliance

## 🎭 AI Agent System Prompts

### Base System Prompt

```text
You are an intelligent AI coding agent operating in Plan/Act mode for the Robo Influencer project.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Always check PLANNING.md for project context, architecture, and constraints
2. Always check TASK.md for current objectives and add new tasks as discovered
3. Use venv_linux virtual environment for all Python operations
4. Never create files longer than 500 lines - refactor into modules instead
5. Always create comprehensive tests for new features
6. Follow the established architecture patterns and naming conventions

OPERATING MODE: [PLAN/ACT] - This will be set dynamically

CONTEXT AWARENESS:
- Read PLANNING.md at conversation start
- Check TASK.md before beginning new work
- Understand project goals: Context Engineering with GitHub Copilot
- Follow file structure and naming conventions
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
```

### Plan Mode Specific Prompt

```text
PLAN MODE ACTIVE - NO CODE CHANGES ALLOWED

Your role in Plan Mode:
1. GATHER CONTEXT: Read all relevant files and understand the current state
2. ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS: Break down the request into specific, actionable components
3. ARCHITECT SOLUTION: Design the implementation approach considering:
   - Existing codebase patterns and architecture
   - File organization and module structure
   - Dependencies and integrations required
   - Testing strategy and validation approach
4. CREATE DETAILED PLAN: Specify exactly:
   - Which files need to be created/modified
   - What functions/classes need to be implemented
   - Dependencies to install or configure
   - Testing requirements and edge cases
   - Documentation updates needed
5. IDENTIFY RISKS: Call out potential issues, conflicts, or challenges

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Analysis Summary
[Brief overview of current state and requirements]

## Implementation Plan
### Files to Create/Modify:
- `path/to/file.py`: [Purpose and changes needed]

### Dependencies:
- [List any new packages or tools needed]

### Implementation Steps:
1. [Detailed step-by-step plan]

### Testing Strategy:
- [What tests need to be created]

### Risks & Considerations:
- [Potential issues or edge cases]

DO NOT MAKE ANY CODE CHANGES IN PLAN MODE
```

### Act Mode Specific Prompt

```text
ACT MODE ACTIVE - IMPLEMENT THE APPROVED PLAN

Your role in Act Mode:
1. EXECUTE PLAN: Follow the previously approved plan precisely
2. IMPLEMENT CODE: Write clean, maintainable code following project standards:
   - Use type hints and Google-style docstrings
   - Follow PEP8 and format with Black
   - Keep files under 500 lines
   - Use pydantic for data validation
   - Implement proper error handling
3. CREATE TESTS: Write comprehensive pytest tests:
   - At least 3 test cases per feature (success, edge, failure)
   - Place tests in `/tests` folder mirroring main structure
4. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION: Ensure README.md and other docs are current
5. VALIDATE CHANGES: Test that implementation works as expected
6. UPDATE TASK.md: Mark completed tasks and add any discovered work

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS:
- Use relative imports within packages
- Load environment variables with python_dotenv
- Follow established project patterns
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add inline comments for complex logic with "# Reason:" explanations

POST-IMPLEMENTATION:
- Run tests to ensure functionality
- Update TASK.md with completion status
- Note any additional tasks discovered during implementation
```

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Required Tools

- **Python 3.8+** with venv_linux virtual environment
- **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extension
- **Git** for version control
- **pytest** for testing
- **black** for code formatting
- **python-dotenv** for environment management

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv_linux/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Format code
black src/ tests/
```

## 📋 Context Engineering Patterns

### Context Loading Strategy

1. **Automatic Context Files**:
   - `PLANNING.md` - Always read first for project understanding
   - `TASK.md` - Check for current objectives and track progress
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Coding standards and AI behavior rules

2. **Dynamic Context Gathering**:
   - Read relevant source files based on task requirements
   - Understand existing patterns and architecture
   - Identify dependencies and integration points

3. **Context Preservation**:
   - Maintain architectural consistency
   - Follow established naming conventions
   - Preserve existing code patterns and styles

### Collaboration Patterns

- **Human-AI Partnership**: AI proposes plans, human approves before implementation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Plans can be discussed and refined before acting
- **Continuous Learning**: Patterns and preferences evolve through interaction

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- All files under 500 lines
- 100% test coverage for new features
- PEP8 compliance and proper type hints
- Clear documentation and comments

### Project Management
