# TASK.md - Project Roadmap & Active Tasks

## üéØ Current Sprint Goals

**Sprint**: Initial Setup & Architecture
**Timeline**: July 11, 2025 - July 18, 2025
**Focus**: Establish foundational AI agent architecture and context engineering framework

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### July 11, 2025
- [x] **Research Plan/Act Approach** - Investigated Claude Code and Cline methodologies for AI agent design
- [x] **Create PLANNING.md** - Established comprehensive AI agent system architecture and prompts
- [x] **Create TASK.md** - Set up project task tracking and roadmap system
- [x] **Generate Alex-Persona AI Chatbot PRP** - Created comprehensive PRP for LangGraph-based conversational AI with RAG and persona modeling
- [x] **Extract Human-in-the-Loop PRP** - Split human-in-the-loop functionality into separate enhancement PRP for future implementation
- [x] **Windows Environment Compatibility** - Updated all shell commands, paths, and virtual environment references for Windows/PowerShell compatibility

## üöß Active Tasks

- [ ] **Implement Alex-Persona AI Chatbot** - Execute the comprehensive PRP for the core LangGraph-based conversational AI system (base functionality)

## üìã Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop Enhancement** - Implement the comprehensive human-in-the-loop PRP as an enhancement to the base chatbot
- [ ] **Setup Development Environment** - Create virtual environment and install dependencies
- [ ] **Create Base Agent Architecture** - Implement core agent classes and interfaces
- [ ] **Implement Plan/Act Mode System** - Build mode switching and state management
- [ ] **Context Engineering Framework** - Develop context loading and management system

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Testing Infrastructure** - Set up pytest framework and testing patterns
- [ ] **Documentation System** - Create API documentation and usage guides
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Implement settings and environment variable handling
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring** - Add structured logging and performance tracking

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Web Interface** - Build simple UI for interacting with agents
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace** - System for managing multiple specialized agents
- [ ] **Integration Testing** - End-to-end testing of agent workflows
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Benchmarking and optimization of agent operations

## üîç Discovered During Work

### July 11, 2025 - PRP Generation Process
- **Alex-Persona AI Chatbot PRP** - Comprehensive research revealed:
  - Strong conversation examples available in `.\convos\` folder demonstrating Alex's communication style
  - Clear technical expertise patterns: RAG platforms, AI agent development, engineering leadership
  - OpenAI embeddings API best practices for conversation chunking and semantic search
  - Need for careful speaker identification in markdown conversation parsing
  - LangGraph workflow patterns for RAG-powered conversational AI

### July 11, 2025 - PRP Modularization
- **Human-in-the-Loop Extraction** - Separated complex human approval workflows into dedicated enhancement PRP:
  - Core Alex-Persona chatbot focuses on essential RAG and persona modeling functionality
  - Human-in-the-loop enhancement provides advanced approval workflows for future implementation
  - Cleaner implementation path: base functionality first, then advanced features
  - LangGraph human-in-the-loop patterns preserved for future enhancement development
  - Human-in-the-loop CLI UX requires thoughtful design for approval workflows
- **Windows Environment Updates** - Updated entire codebase for Windows compatibility:
  - Changed from `venv_linux` to `.venv` virtual environment references
  - Replaced `bash` commands with PowerShell equivalents
  - Updated path separators from Unix `/` to Windows `\` style
  - Changed `source activate` to `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Replaced `ls` with `Get-ChildItem`, `curl` with `Invoke-RestMethod`
  - Updated `tree` command reference to PowerShell equivalent

## üìù Notes & Ideas

### Context Engineering Insights
- Plan/Act approach provides clear separation between analysis and implementation
- Automatic context file loading (PLANNING.md, TASK.md) ensures consistency
- Human approval gates prevent unwanted code changes

### Architecture Decisions
- Maximum 500 lines per file to maintain modularity
- Agent-specific modules (agent.py, tools.py, prompts.py) for organization
- Mirror test structure to source code for clarity

### Future Considerations
- Integration with GitHub Copilot for enhanced code generation
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Context persistence across sessions
- Advanced prompt engineering techniques
