# TASK.md - Project Roadmap & Active Tasks

## üéØ Current Sprint Goals

**Sprint**: Initial Setup & Architecture
**Timeline**: July 11, 2025 - July 18, 2025
**Focus**: Establish foundational AI agent architecture and context engineering framework

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### July 11, 2025
- [x] **Research Plan/Act Approach** - Investigated Claude Code and Cline methodologies for AI agent design
- [x] **Create PLANNING.md** - Established comprehensive AI agent system architecture and prompts
- [x] **Create TASK.md** - Set up project task tracking and roadmap system

## üöß Active Tasks

No active tasks currently in progress.

## üìã Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] **Setup Development Environment** - Create virtual environment and install dependencies
- [ ] **Create Base Agent Architecture** - Implement core agent classes and interfaces
- [ ] **Implement Plan/Act Mode System** - Build mode switching and state management
- [ ] **Context Engineering Framework** - Develop context loading and management system

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Testing Infrastructure** - Set up pytest framework and testing patterns
- [ ] **Documentation System** - Create API documentation and usage guides
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Implement settings and environment variable handling
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring** - Add structured logging and performance tracking

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Web Interface** - Build simple UI for interacting with agents
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace** - System for managing multiple specialized agents
- [ ] **Integration Testing** - End-to-end testing of agent workflows
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Benchmarking and optimization of agent operations

## üîç Discovered During Work

Tasks discovered during development will be added here.

## üìù Notes & Ideas

### Context Engineering Insights
- Plan/Act approach provides clear separation between analysis and implementation
- Automatic context file loading (PLANNING.md, TASK.md) ensures consistency
- Human approval gates prevent unwanted code changes

### Architecture Decisions
- Maximum 500 lines per file to maintain modularity
- Agent-specific modules (agent.py, tools.py, prompts.py) for organization
- Mirror test structure to source code for clarity

### Future Considerations
- Integration with GitHub Copilot for enhanced code generation
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Context persistence across sessions
- Advanced prompt engineering techniques
