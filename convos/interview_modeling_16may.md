**John (00:00):** Hi Alexey, thanks for joining me today. I'm John, and I'm a hiring manager here at Workday. We're excited to talk to you about the Software Engineering Manager role for our AI team. To start, could you tell me a bit about your background and what interested you in this specific opportunity at Workday?

**Alexey (00:30):** Hi John, thanks for having me. I'm an Engineering Manager with over 15 years of experience, primarily focused on leading teams in building AI platforms and enhancing developer experiences. Most recently at Microsoft, I led a team developing AI agent experiences, including a RAG-based platform, which significantly boosted engineer productivity.

What draws me to Workday, and this role in particular, is your clear commitment to leveraging AI to enhance user experience in enterprise software. The job description's emphasis on "conversational experiences powered by an agent platform" and developing "cutting-edge agentic experiences" aligns perfectly with my recent work and passion. I'm particularly interested in how Workday is approaching the integration of these AI experiences into the core product UI to create a natural interaction model. My experience building a similar platform for 15,000 Microsoft engineers, focusing on usability and real-world impact, seems very relevant here.

**John (02:00):** That's great to hear, Alexey. Your experience with RAG-based AI agents and scaling solutions for a large user base at Microsoft is indeed very relevant. The job description mentions building and leading a full-stack development team. Can you describe your experience in hiring, mentoring, and developing engineering talent, especially in an agile environment with tight deadlines?

**Alexey (02:30):** Absolutely. At Microsoft, I built and scaled a full-stack team from 4 to 9 engineers, working with .NET and Python services. A key part of my role was talent development. I successfully mentored team members leading to 6 promotions, ranging from SWE2 to Principal. I believe in fostering a culture of continuous feedback and inclusion, and I've implemented structured career growth programs and mentorship initiatives, like a "Coding Buddy" program for an engineer who needed extra support, which proved successful.

We operated in a highly agile CI/CD environment with multiple daily deployments. My approach to leadership in such a setting is to establish a clear mission and customer focus, which I found transformed my team at Microsoft into a high-performing unit. This involved not just hiring the right skills but also ensuring the team was aligned and motivated, even when facing challenging deadlines.

**John (04:15):** Transforming an unfocused team and achieving 6 promotions is impressive. The role here involves developing AI platform solutions and working with application teams to bring agentic applications to market quickly. Could you share an example of a complex AI-driven project you led, highlighting how you collaborated with product management, design, and other stakeholders to deliver it?

**Alexey (04:45):** Certainly. At Microsoft, I led the development and execution of a RAG-based AI agent platform. This platform was designed to provide contextual assistance to 15,000 internal engineers by integrating with Teams and over 150 enterprise products. The goal was to save engineer-hours by providing quick, accurate answers and guidance extracted from vast internal knowledge bases.

Collaboration was critical. I worked very closely with Product Management to define the roadmap, prioritize features based on user impact, and iterate based on feedback. With the Design team, we focused on creating an intuitive and seamless agentic UI. We had multiple daily deployments, so a tight feedback loop with these teams and our end-users was essential. We also had to engage with numerous engineering teams across Microsoft to ensure our platform could be extended and integrated effectively – this involved understanding their specific needs and ensuring our Model Context Protocol (MCP) was robust and developer-friendly. The result was a platform that saved over 1,500 engineer-hours weekly.

**John (06:30):** That sounds like a significant and impactful project. You mentioned MCP and integrating with various products. The Workday role also emphasizes an "agent platform which provides the capabilities needed to quickly develop the high-value agents for specific roles." Can you elaborate on your experience in building platform capabilities that enable other teams to build on top of your work?

**Alexey (07:00):** Yes, the RAG platform I mentioned was fundamentally designed as an extensible system. We used Azure OpenAI and developed what we called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to allow other teams to easily plug in their specific data sources and define contextual understanding for the AI agent. This meant the platform wasn't just a monolithic application but a set of services and APIs that other engineering teams could leverage to build their own specialized AI assistants without reinventing the core RAG capabilities.

My role involved architecting this for extensibility from day one, defining clear API contracts, providing documentation, and actively engaging with early adopter teams to ensure the platform met their needs. This approach significantly accelerated the adoption and impact of AI assistance across different engineering groups at Microsoft. We saw over 340 contributors to the platform's ecosystem, which I believe speaks to its success as an enabler.

**John (08:45):** That's a great example of platform thinking. The job description also mentions "Industry awareness of AI applications, especially in enterprise software." How do you stay current with the rapid advancements in AI/ML, and how do you see these trends shaping the future of enterprise software like Workday?

**Alexey (09:15):** I'm passionate about AI/ML and make it a priority to stay current. I actively follow key researchers and labs, read papers, attend virtual conferences, and experiment with new tools and frameworks. My recent "Career Essentials in Generative AI" certification from Microsoft and LinkedIn is one example of formalizing that learning. Within Microsoft, I was part of internal communities focused on AI advancements.

For enterprise software like Workday, I see AI, particularly generative AI and agentic systems, as transformative. It's moving beyond simple automation to becoming a true partner for employees. This means more intuitive interfaces, proactive assistance, personalized workflows, and the ability to unlock insights from complex data in natural language. For a platform like Workday, which touches so many aspects of an employee's lifecycle, AI can make processes more efficient, data more accessible, and the overall employee experience significantly better. The key is to build these AI capabilities in a way that is trustworthy, secure, and genuinely helpful to the user.

**John (11:00):** I agree, the potential is huge. One of the responsibilities listed is to "Work with program managers, peers and team members to set the best technical direction for your team and the overall organization." Can you describe a situation where you had to influence technical direction, perhaps when there were differing opinions?

**Alexey (11:30):** At Microsoft, we faced a significant challenge regarding vulnerability management and reducing the secure perimeter of our engineering systems. There were strong, differing opinions between central security teams advocating for tighter restrictions and engineering teams (including my own) concerned about the impact on productivity and development velocity.

My approach was to first deeply understand the concerns and technical arguments from all sides. I then facilitated a series of discussions, bringing data and specific use cases to the table to illustrate the potential impacts of various proposals. I championed a solution that involved a phased approach, implementing critical security measures immediately while also investing in automation and tooling (like the Azure DevCenter and DevBox provisioning I led) to mitigate the productivity impact for engineers. It required careful negotiation and finding a balanced solution that addressed the core security needs without unduly hampering innovation. Ultimately, we reached a consensus that was adopted, and it involved influencing peers, management, and stakeholders in other organizations.

**John (13:15):** That's a good example of navigating complex stakeholder environments. We're looking for someone who can "Energize your team and have fun engineering software!" How do you foster a positive and energized team environment, especially when dealing with the pressures of a fast-paced AI field?

**Alexey (13:45):** I believe fostering a positive environment starts with a clear, shared mission that the team believes in. When engineers understand the "why" behind their work and see its impact, it's incredibly motivating. For my team at Microsoft, focusing on improving the daily lives of 15,000 fellow engineers was a powerful energizer.

Beyond that, I encourage a culture of learning and experimentation. In AI, things change so fast, so it's crucial to allow space for trying new things, even if they sometimes fail. Celebrating successes, both big and small, is important. I also promote open communication, psychological safety, and ensuring everyone feels their contributions are valued. We had regular team events, knowledge-sharing sessions, and I made sure to model a positive and approachable attitude. Recognizing individual achievements and supporting career growth, as I mentioned with the promotions, also contributes significantly to team morale and energy. And yes, finding moments for humor and fun, even amidst tight deadlines, is key!

**John (15:30):** That aligns well with our values at Workday. We have a few minutes left. What questions do you have for me about the role, the team, or Workday?

**Alexey (15:45):** Thank you, John. I have a couple of questions.
1.  The job description mentions the AI team is in the UI Platform organization. Could you elaborate on the current interaction model between the core AI platform team and the specific application teams that would be building agents on top of it? How is that collaboration structured?
2.  Workday is committed to "discovering new and innovative applications of AI." What is the current process for ideation and experimentation within the AI teams? How much autonomy does a manager and their team have to explore new AI capabilities or applications?
3.  Finally, what do you see as the biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity for this AI team in the next 12-18 months?

**John (17:00):** Those are excellent questions, Alexey.
1.  Regarding the interaction model: The UI Platform organization houses several teams, including the core AI agent platform team you'd be managing. This team provides the foundational services, frameworks, and APIs. Application teams across Workday (e.g., HCM, Financials) then leverage this platform to build specific agentic experiences relevant to their domain. The collaboration is typically structured through dedicated points of contact, regular interlock meetings, and shared roadmapping sessions. We also have internal "office hours" and robust documentation to support the app teams. Your team would be a key enabler and partner to these application teams.

2.  For ideation and experimentation: We have a multi-pronged approach. There's a top-down strategic direction set by leadership, but we heavily encourage bottom-up innovation. Teams have dedicated "innovation sprints" or "hack days" periodically. Engineering managers like yourself play a crucial role in fostering this culture, and teams do have a good degree of autonomy to prototype and explore new AI capabilities, especially those that align with our strategic pillars. Promising ideas can then be pitched for further investment.

3.  Biggest challenge and opportunity: The biggest challenge is probably the pace of change in AI and ensuring we're building a platform that is both cutting-edge and scalable/maintainable for the enterprise. Prioritization is also key – there are so many exciting possibilities. The biggest opportunity, without a doubt, is to fundamentally redefine how millions of users interact with enterprise software, making their work lives significantly more productive and intuitive. We believe we're in a unique position to do that.

**Alexey (19:30):** That's very insightful, John. Thank you for the detailed answers. It sounds like a very dynamic and exciting environment.

**John (19:45):** It certainly is. Well, Alexey, we're just about out of time. It was a pleasure speaking with you today. Your experience seems like a strong fit. We'll be in touch regarding the next steps in the process.

**Alexey (20:00):** Thank you, John. I really enjoyed our conversation and learning more about the role and Workday. I look forward to hearing from you.
