# How Alex Shulga’s Microsoft 1ES/Developer Experience Leadership Directly Enables Workday Globalization Success

- **Platform mind-set & horizontal services:**
  - Owned end-to-end Developer-Experience platform used by 60K+ engineers and 150+ internal products at Microsoft.
  - Delivered unified RAG chat and DevCenter APIs that every engineering team plugs into before shipping.
  - Can replicate a “shared-service first” culture in GPE pods, ensuring i18n & MT APIs become mandatory, self-service components for all Workday pillars.

- **AI / Agentic language technology:**
  - Designed and shipped RAG-based, agentic chatbots that answer 4.4K weekly queries and deflect 50% of support incidents.
  - Hands-on with Azure OpenAI, prompt orchestration, retrieval pipelines, and evaluation tooling.
  - Ready to accelerate Globalization’s shift from MT to LLM fine-tunes and agentic QA, reducing translation cycle time and improving terminology accuracy.

- **Quality-at-scale automation:**
  - Led transition from quarterly releases to multiple daily production deployments with CI/CD gates, canary releases, and metric-based rollback.
  - Built telemetry dashboards quantifying 1.5K+ engineering hours saved weekly.
  - Can introduce robust localisation test harnesses, MT quality dashboards, and release gates that stop LDU/i18n regressions before they escape.

- **Reg-tech / compliance awareness:**
  - Provisioned Azure DevBoxes across regions, navigating data-sovereignty, privacy, and security controls for 40K+ users.
  - Partnered with InfoSec & Privacy to codify compliance checks in pipelines.
  - Can apply similar governance patterns to country-specific payroll and tax rule updates, ensuring LDUs ship on time without legal risk.

- **Cross-disciplinary leadership:**
  - Led pods spanning engineers, PM, UX, support, and AI researchers; mentored 6 promotions, managed under-performance, and operated across 12-hour time-zone spreads.
  - Negotiated backlog priorities with 10+ external service owners.
  - Ready to coordinate engineers, linguists, legal analysts, and ML researchers inside Globalization, driving consensus on language coverage and KPIs.

- **Metrics & cost focus:**
  - Fostered a culture of measurable ROI (e.g., cost per engineer-hour saved, support tickets deflected).
  - Can tighten cost-per-word and MT throughput metrics, justifying investment in LLM pipelines with clear OPEX savings.

**Bottom line:**
I bring a proven playbook for building AI-first, compliance-ready, horizontal platforms that thousands rely on daily. Applying these lessons to Workday’s Globalization org will shorten time-to-market for new locales, cut translation costs, and embed agentic AI as a competitive differentiator across every Workday product pillar.
